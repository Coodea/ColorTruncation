This app lets you open an image, apply color-vision (CVD) simulations or assistance, or highlight specific colors, and then save the edited image. When you save, it also writes four CSVs beside the image: *_before_pixels.csv, *_after_pixels.csv (decimal R,G,B per pixel) and *_before_binary.csv, *_after_binary.csv (the same values as 8-bit binary strings). Use the separate RGB Levels Table tool to load your Before/After CSV/TXT files (pixels and binary) and it will compute a single 0–255 value for R, G, and B (Mean/Median/RMS) and show side-by-side tables plus the Δ (after−before). Run the editor with python color_tool_gui_cvd_v7.py and the table comparer with python rgb_levels_gui_table.py. Both tools are GUI-based, keep your original image untouched, and only save when you press S (Save) and choose a name/location.
